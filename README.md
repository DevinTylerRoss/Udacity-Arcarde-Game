Udacity Arcade Game
===============================

This game is the third project for Udacity's Frontend Nanodegree program. The goal of the project 
was to learn and practice object oriented programing. Much of the game code was provided and my task was to wire it together and 
implement the object contructors.

The goal of the game is to get your character to water while avoiding the bugs. The player can move in all directions and colliding with the bugs causes the player position to reset to the begining point.
